How to calculate the strength of a password:

-Only letters/digits/symbols - the password is easy;

-Combination of letters-symbols/letters-digits/digits-symbols - the password is medium;

-Has letters, symbols and numbers - the password is strong;

The color of the sections will depend on the strength of the password:

-If the field is empty, all sections are gray;

-If the field has less than 8 characters, all sections are red;

-If the password is easy - the first section is red the rest are gray;

-If the password is medium - the first two sections are yellow the last one is gray;

-If the password is strong, all sections are green;
